# Chordplay

Chordplay is a web application for guitar instruction, learning, and casual play.

Chordplay allows users to search for songs that contain the songs they know. All songs are aggregated from online guitar tablature databases like <a href"=http://www.ultimate-guitar.com">Ultimate-Guitar</a>, and presented as links to their respective song pages on those databases.

Guests and users alike may input chords to see a list of songs that contain them. A signed-in user gains the ability to bookmark songs for viewing on their personal bookmarked-songs page.
