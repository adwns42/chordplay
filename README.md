Welcome to Chordplay, an application for instruction, learning, and casual play.

Chordplay allows users to search for songs that contain the songs they know. Songs and their chords are aggregated from online guitar tablature databases like <a href"=http://www.ultimate-guitar.com">Ultimate-Guitar</a>

Guests and users alike may input chords to see a list of songs that contain them. A signed-in user gains the ability to bookmark songs for later viewing on their personal bookmarked-songs page.
